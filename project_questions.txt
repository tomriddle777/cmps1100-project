1. How long (cumulative) have you spent on the code?
I can't give a good estimate on how long I have spent on the code, but I would say it is probably over 6 hours and under 24 hours.

2. What was the most time consuming part?
The most time consuming part, besides figuring out how to process a string input to verify its type and value, is structuring the code in such a way that it is possible for future feature additions and unit testing.

3. In retrospect, how could you have worked more efficiently?
I could've worked more efficiently by compartmentalizing everything into classes or functions so unit testing more functions become possible.

4. What libraries/starter code were most useful? To what extent did you need to modify them? 
The one single part of the chatgpt code that was most helpful was its code for counting the value when there are aces in the hand. I had another version I attempted to make myself out of curiousity that sort of worked, but chatgpt's solution was simpler and made more sense in the context of how I wanted to structure my code.
