# cmps1100-project
This is a project to make a text-based blackjack game. As of now, it has a wager system with an intital bet bankroll of 1000, with infinite rounds until the player bankrupts. Currently, the player has the option of hit and stand. Blackjack pays 3 to 2 and dealer stands to all 17 totals.

To run the code, download blackjack.py. If you have python or python3 installed, you can run the code by going to the directory in which you have downloaded the blackjack.py file and type "python3 blackjack.py". You can also run the code by opening the file in an IDE of your choice.
