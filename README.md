# cmps1100-project
This is a project to make a text-based blackjack game. As of now, it has a wager system with an intital bet bankroll of 1000, with infinite rounds until the player bankrupts. I have implemented what I feel are standard casino rules, with the exception of resplitting--no resplitting allowed at all. 

It is a classic 6 deck game, where dealer adds a plastic cutoff card somwhere around 75-90% of the shoe, depending on your dealer, or in this game, luck. Dealer stands on soft 17, and you can only double on hard totals of 9, 10, and 11. Beside being able to hit and stand, you can insure, surrender (late surrender), double (under conditions outlined above), split, and double (again, with conditions) after split. You cannot hit after split if you split aces. If you bust, you lose but the dealer will continue playing out their hand even though it doesn't matter. There is a handy auto counter that keeps track of the count for card counters, with both the running count and true count.

To run the code, download blackjack.py. If you have python3 installed, you can run the code in command line by going to the directory in which you have downloaded the blackjack.py file and type "python3 blackjack.py". You can also run the code by opening the file in an IDE of your choice and running it.
